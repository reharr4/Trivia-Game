Timed Trivia
*I created a basic trivia game with multiple choice options.
*The player has limited time to finish the game. Regardless of whether or not all questions are answered, the game will end when times runs out.
*There is a timer counting down the remaining time.
*The player should NOT be able to choose more than one answer per question.
